Run the bot: 
 - create a bot in discord and generate a key for the bot (Make sure the bot can read messages in chat)
 - download the code
 - open the "Bot" folder
 - open the file "DreadAwakeningDiscordBot.dll.config"
 - replace "YOUR_BOT_KEY" with the key generated before
 - run the exe in the "Bot" folder

 - users should now be able to type !collection {GU-id} in chat. where {GU-id} is the users Gods Unchained Id


All code can be reviewed. If you don't trust the exe, you can build the bot yourself using the available code.
You can make your own changes to the bot if desired. 
Code is delivered as is.
